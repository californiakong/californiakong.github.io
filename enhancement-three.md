## Databases

My enhancement for the database category involved adding an SQL feature to my Android application from CS-360. The application could not originally change the quantity when ordering. For my planned enhancement I have added the ability to select a quantity when ordering. If the user decides to make a change, they are able to either delete the entire order or change the quantity. In order to add this feature, I needed to make several changes and improvements to the code. The SQL database did not previously include quantity, so this was added. I also made some changes to the order UI to facilitate adding a quantity feature. Lastly, I included code that saves and retrieves the quantity amount in the order and checkout screens. I encountered several difficulties during this process. A major issue I encountered involved the database handler incorrectly reading and sending data. This issue involved a significant amount of time to troubleshoot and fix. The final submission meets all improvements listed in my initial plan.
