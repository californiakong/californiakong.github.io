# Bryce Zimbelman Portfolio

## Professional Self-Assessment

  Throughout my programming experience I have learned about databases, software engineering, and algorithms. I have been able to gain valuable experience in these areas of computer science. I have learned about database design including how to manage and store information in an SQL or NoSQL database. I have learned about developing APIâ€™s and designing a software project. I have worked in collaboration with other students using Git. Team participation was required as well as the successful management of a group Git project.
  
  Version control tools, such as Git, are an important role in software development. Since all code changes related to a specific project are tracked version control software contributes to stability, reliability, and accountability. Version control software aids debugging as prior known working code can be compared to a newer version of the project. A developer can focus on a portion of the code, line by line, to identify and fix problematic code. Since Git allows for each team member to download a local version of the project, collaborative development can occur remotely. A developer may work independently as needed and push code updates to the project for review. Once their code update has been verified their new addition to the project may be merged with the main branch.
  
  Much of my work has been writing intensive which has allowed me to develop my communication skills. My work regarding data structures and algorithms has included, storing, traversing, sorting, and searching for information. As part of my portfolio, I developed a weather station that follows an algorithm to monitor, calculate, and store weather information. During my coursework, I have designed and written Android applications. My portfolio features an Android application that is designed as a coffee shop ordering tool. The enhancements for my portfolio included re-designing the user interface and adding a quantity selection when ordering using SQLite. In addition to these skills, I have worked on reverse engineering a binary file and recreating the program in C. Throughout all of these programming projects and exercises secure programming practices have been emphasized.
