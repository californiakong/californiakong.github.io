## Algorithms and Data Structure

My enhancement for the algorithms and data structures enhancement is a weather station project originally from CS-350. The weather station was the final project for that course in the form of a python script to be run on a Raspberry Pi. The weather station also utilizes various sensors from a GrovePi kit such as a temperature and humidity sensor, light sensor, and lights as output. For my enhancement, I added many features such as a separate day and night mode, calculate and output weather stats, and an increased temperature range. Adding these features included a significant amount of additional code. I ran into many challenges while working on this enhancement. Facing issues was to be expected as part of the debugging process while working on this type of project. As I worked, I discovered some logic errors in my design that needed to be rethought. After my initial submission, I was able to incorporate many additional changes including adding humidity stats and simplifying the code. My final submission incorporates functions designed to reduce similar code while providing the desired outcome. My final submission reflects a significantly polished program and exceeds my initial improvement plan.
