## Software Design and Engineering

My enhancement for the software design and engineering is an Android application designed as an ordering app for a coffee shop. The application was originally created for CS-360 as my final project and the culmination of my work in that course. The enhancement revolves around improving the visual appearance of the application. I have achieved this goal through three major changes. I added a background image to the application which provides a refined look to the entire app experience. I added a logo to most screens inside of the application to provide a professional image for the business. Lastly, I changed the appearance of the buttons found throughout the application to provide a modern aesthetic to the app. In addition, I also made small changes such as changing the color of the text to white and changed some of the text to a bold typeface to improve readability. Throughout the process, I learned the importance of attention to detail. When working with the user interface implementing a change may result in a problem such as content running off-screen or text becoming hard to read. I encountered both of these issues during my work on this project. I was able to overcome these problems by making minor adjustments to the text and other areas of the interface. I was able to solve the issues I faced by paying attention to detail and consulting Android documentation when necessary.
