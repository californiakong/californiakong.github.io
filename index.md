## Profile

  I am a recent Computer Science graduate from Southern New Hampshire University. I have experience developing with Python, Java, C++, Android, and Git. Two significant projects I have worked on include developing an Android ordering application and a Raspberry Pi Weather Station.
  
## Android Ordering Application
  
This project is a coffee shop Android ordering application. The application is programmed in Java and utilizes an SQLite database. The application provides a menu, information about the business, and the ability to add and remove items of an order.

## Raspberry Pi Weather Station

This project is a weather station designed for use on a Raspberry Pi. It is programmed using Python and catalogs temperature and humidity information during day and night cycles. After each cycle this information is used to calculate weather stats and is output into a JSON file.
